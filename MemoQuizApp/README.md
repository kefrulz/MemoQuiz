# MemoQuizApp

A simple SwiftUI iOS quiz application that loads questions from the text file `Quizquestions`.

## Building
1. Open the `MemoQuizApp` folder in Xcode.
2. Ensure the `Quizquestions` resource is included in the app target.
3. Build and run on an iOS device or simulator (requires iOS 16 or later).

The questions are parsed at runtime and presented in random order.
